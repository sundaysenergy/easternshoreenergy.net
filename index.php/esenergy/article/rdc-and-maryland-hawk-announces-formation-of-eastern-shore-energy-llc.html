<div class="title">RDC and Maryland Hawk Announces Formation Of Eastern Shore Energy, LLC </div><br />
The University of Maryland Eastern Shore announced today the formation of renewable energy development company, Eastern Shore Energy, LLC. The new company will focus on creating renewable energy projects at multiple sites on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland. The company’s goal is to develop systems capable of generating 100 to 150 megawatts from wind, solar and biomass projects. The regional initiative is the result of a partnership between the Maryland Hawk Corporation, (a non-profit affiliate of the university) and National Renewable Solutions, LLC of Minneapolis, MN, an affiliate of National Wind, LLC.<br /><br />
<img src="../../../photos/2011-06-21_mdhawk_partners.jpg" alt="phot" height="253" width="450" border="1" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right" />“The launch of Eastern Shore Energy represents the culmination of UMES’s recent efforts to promote the development of renewable energy production within our region,” said Dr. Ronald Forsythe, UMES’s vice president of technology and commercialization. UMES sponsored the development of a 2 megawatt solar project on campus two years ago, Forsythe said, “and we have been seeking to continue the effort to support renewable energy development ever since.<br />
<br />
“We believe the community-ownership development model favored by National Renewable Solutions will create the greatest economic value for our region, as well as foster continuing educational benefits for UMES students,” Forsythe said. Eastern Shore Energy LLC currently is studying the feasibility of three wind projects within Somerset and Worcester counties and expects to identify additional sites over the next several months.<br />
<br />
<img src="../../../photos/IMG_1597.jpg" alt="photo" height="300" width="450" border="1" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right" />“We believe the current sites offer the opportunity for the first 30-to-60 megawatts of wind development potential within these two counties, and we are encouraged with the initial findings,” said Patrick Pelstring, president of National Renewable Solutions, LLC, who serves as manager of the new development company. “Maryland Hawk Corporation will play a key role in our success in this effort, and ESE’s ownership structure is consistent with our community ownership model,” Pelstring said. Daniel S. Kuennen, Maryland Hawk Corp.’s executive director, said, “We’ve made definite headway on several fronts.”<br />
<br />
“By creating a development partnership with a national renewable energy company, we believe we are providing a business model for local individuals and companies to benefit, and helping reduce the continuing escalation in electric congestion charges on our local utility bills through local area generation,” Kuennen said. The company’s next steps will include installing anemometers on towers in the two target counties to collect wind data, and seeking participation of public and private landowners in the company’s prospective development projects. ESE expects this initiative will be a long-term commitment of five-to-seven years, but hopes to have its first project ready for construction in the next 24-36 months.<br />
